            This is a full stack application, which demonstrates that I
            understand the concept of authentication in web development, concept
            of CRUD and usage of Databases. A user is authenticated through
            Google Oauth to gain access to send a survey to clientâ€™s email,
            which is routed from the client side of the application to the
            server side.
          </p>
